The purpose of this project is to develop an application with a series of modules based on
day to day problems that people often observe while travelling on road.

Almost 85% of the people observe:
 Major accidents but they just ignore because they are busy or hesitate to help due to
intimidation by police.
 Injured animals crying in pain.
 Heaps of garbage dumped on the roads.
 Fallen trees on roads which blocks the way of the people travelling, cause accidents
and traffic jams.
 Old, needy people sleeping on footpath who don’t have basic daily needs
